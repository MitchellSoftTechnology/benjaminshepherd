	<h2>Biography</h2>

	<p>Benjamin began Artistic Gymnastics at the age of 7 with Julie Kew at
	Worle Gymnastics Club (now <a href="http://www.j21gymnastics.co.uk/">
	J21 Gymnastics Club</a>). He competed regularly, with great success, and 
	travelled across the UK to various training camps with National and 
	International Coaches. His talent, determination, quality coaching and 
	familial support helped him to progress through the ranks of the sport, 
	culminating in him winning silver at the British National Tumbling Finals, 
	aged just 13.</p> 
	
	<p>Sadly, at 14, the symptoms of glandular fever rendered him unable to 
	maintain gymnastics’ physical demands and, as a result, Benjamin was unable to
	continue in the sport. He qualified as a coach and maintained close
	contact with the sport, coaching in London and at J21 during his
	University holidays.</p>
	
	<p>At 22, Benjamin knew it wasn't too late for him.
	Against all odds, he began training again, in London, at 
	<a href="http://www.richmondgymnastics.co.uk/">Richmond
	Gymnastics Association</a>. Within less than a year, he won gold at the
	2008 British National Tumbling Finals, and then again in both 2009 and 2011!</p>
