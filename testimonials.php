	<h2>Testimonials</h2>
	
	<p><q>Scarlett is really happy with Ben - great choice - she is already improving
	beyond recognition. Thank you.</q>
	<br /><cite>Gaby Zein</cite>, Parent</p>
	
	<p><q>You've done something amazing to those girls! Last night Rae composed and
	wrote lyrics for her first song, and Mabel was jamming in an abstract style!
	They're very taken with you, a treat to see. Thanks.</q>
	<br /><cite>Julie Stockley</cite>, Parent</p>
	
	<p><q>Ben is absolutely wonderful, and he is one of our most respected teachers. I
	think he will be a great inspiration for Thomas. He is an extremely determined
	and well organised individual, who is not only a professional pianist but also a
	professional gymnast!</q>

	<p><q>Ben is great. He has managed to inspire Fraser and suddenly (and at last)
	Fraser is wanting to play every day! Fantastic.</q>

	<p><q>It was only Jemima's second lesson but she had already mastered her hand
	position, and was happily jumping around the keyboard at octave intervals ... 
	Jemima proudly played 'Hot Cross Buns' ... rhythm was being reinforced with
	clapping and rhymes.</q>

    <p><q>Benjamin has a natural and sensitive musicality, and an intrinsic ease at
	the piano ... he has very special gifts which would make him an outstanding teacher.</q>

	<p><q>I rate Ben Shepherd very highly indeed. He is a serious musician, totally open
	and committed to whatever he does. He has a natural and gentle presence, which children
	will appreciate. He takes health and well-being responsibly, has a professional 
	attitude ... He will be a patient and considerate teacher and I recommend him highly.</q>

	<p><q>Kimberly tells me that you were an hour early to your session with Mrs
	Fletcher on Tuesday, due to your concern with time and the weather
	situation ... I'd just like to say thanks for this. I think it shows great
	commitment and total professionalism that you were prepared to leave
	enough time to make sure their session would not be affected; this is
	precisely what I admire and need from our professors.</q>
